    "-Low Variance and Low Bias predict good result by models\n",
    "- Low Variance means -> all results are more closer to each other(low scatter)  Low Bias-> all results are near to target \n",
    "- Hight variance and high Bias -> Results are spread  all over (outliers)\n",
    "- Model complexity is low when model is high Bias and low variance(left). In this case ,Training dataset and test data set both has high prediction error \n",
